### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a fresh graduate from Singapore Management University with a Bachelor of Science (Information Systems). My first major is Business Analytics and my second major is Accountancy. I plan to further my studies and want to work in the financial industry in the future.
I like to use Python for data analytics because of the libraries that comes with it. 

I am just starting out learning GitHub and am not too familiar with it yet! Please be patient with me~ ðŸ˜„

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as an Analyst at aAdvantage Consulting
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Telegram is probably the best way
- âš¡ Fun fact: I played Mobile Legends competitively in my undergraduate days
